        <section class="mb-6">
            <p>In October 2024, I embarked on the <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/"
                    class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Cloud Resume Challenge</a>, a hands-on project that
                transformed my understanding of cloud computing and security. With a background in video production and
                strategic communication, I was eager to pivot into cloud security. For years, I’ve dreamed of learning
                and working in IT, particularly in the dynamic field of cloud security. The challenge, created by
                Forrest Brazeal, pushed me to build a serverless resume website on AWS,
                automate its deployment, and implement advanced security measures. The result? A fully functional,
                secure website at <a href="https://trisoncloudresume.com"
                    class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">trisoncloudresume.com</a> and a portfolio that showcases my
                skills in AWS, Terraform, and CI/CD. Here’s a breakdown of my journey, the skills I gained, and the
                security mods that make this project stand out.</p>

        <section class="mb-6">
            <h2 class="section-title">The Challenge: Building a Serverless Resume</h2>
            <p>The Cloud Resume Challenge tasked me with creating a resume website using AWS services, hosted on an S3
                bucket and served via CloudFront, with a visitor counter powered by Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. I
                used Route 53 for DNS and ACM for SSL/TLS certificates to ensure HTTPS. To automate infrastructure
                deployment, I adopted Terraform, defining resources like S3 buckets, CloudFront distributions, and
                Lambda functions. For continuous deployment, I set up a GitHub Actions pipeline to upload static files
                to S3 and invalidate the CloudFront cache whenever I pushed changes to my repository.</p>
            <p>The core project was a learning journey in and of itself. I take pride in the fact that the project is
                typically completed by those with years of IT experience and rarely by someone like me, with none. That
                said, I’m equally proud of the four security mods I completed for this website: <i>Spoof Troop</i>,
                <i>Check Your Privilege</i>, <i>Wall of Fire</i>, and <i>Chain Reaction</i>. These mods elevated my
                project from a basic website to a secure, production-ready application.

            <h2 class="section-title">Security Mods: Hardening the Resume Website</h2>
            <h3>Spoof Troop: Securing DNS with Route 53 and DNSSEC</h3>
            <p>The <i>Spoof Troop</i> mod focused on protecting my domain’s DNS records. Using Route 53, I configured
                DNSSEC with a KMS key for signing, safeguarding <a href="https://trisoncloudresume.com"
                    class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">trisoncloudresume.com</a> against DNS spoofing attacks. This
                ensured that users visiting my site were directed to the correct CloudFront distribution, not a
                malicious impostor. Implementing DNSSEC taught me the importance of cryptographic integrity in DNS and
                how to manage KMS keys securely.</p>
            <h3>Check Your Privilege: Enforcing Least Privilege</h3>
            <p>The <i>Check Your Privilege</i> mod emphasized the principle of least privilege across my AWS resources.
                I managed separate production and test accounts, restricting Lambda functions and API Gateway roles to
                minimal permissions for DynamoDB and CloudWatch Logs. This reduced the risk of unauthorized access and
                demonstrated my ability to implement fine-grained IAM policies, a critical skill for cloud security
                roles.</p>
            <h3>Wall of Fire: Deploying a Web Application Firewall</h3>
            <p>The <i>Wall of Fire</i> mod added a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect my CloudFront distribution.
                I created a Web ACL named <code>VisitorCountWAF</code> with the
                <code>AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet</code>, blocking common web attacks like SQL injection and XSS.
                Associating the WAF with my distribution was a challenge due to CLI errors and console visibility
                issues, but I resolved them by ensuring the global scope and updating IAM permissions. Verifying the
                WAF’s association solidified my understanding of integrating security layers into cloud applications.
            </p>
            <h3>Chain Reaction: Securing the CI/CD Pipeline</h3>
            <p>The <i>Chain Reaction</i> mod hardened my GitHub Actions pipeline, reducing the risk of supply chain
                attacks. I limited repository permissions to <code>contents: read</code>, removed sensitive debug
                outputs, and scoped IAM permissions for my deployment user to minimal actions on S3, CloudFront, and
                Terraform operations. Troubleshooting Terraform permission errors required iterative IAM policy updates,
                teaching me the nuances of least-privilege automation. The result was a secure, automated pipeline that
                deploys my resume reliably.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Key Takeaways</h2>
            <p>The Cloud Resume Challenge was more than a technical exercise; it was a journey into cloud security best
                practices. I gained hands-on experience with:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li><strong>AWS Services</strong>: S3, CloudFront, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Route 53, ACM, IAM,
                    WAF, KMS.</li>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure-as-Code</strong>: Writing Terraform to define and manage resources across
                    multiple accounts.</li>
                <li><strong>CI/CD Automation</strong>: Configuring GitHub Actions for seamless deployments.</li>
                <li><strong>Security Principles</strong>: Implementing DNSSEC, least privilege, WAF protection, and
                    pipeline hardening.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The project was very challenging, but I’m glad I persisted. I wrestled with IAM permission errors,
                console visibility issues, and Terraform state mismatches, but each obstacle deepened my understanding
                of AWS and cloud security. My resume now lives at <a href="https://trisoncloudresume.com"
                    class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">trisoncloudresume.com</a>, a testament to my ability to build
                and secure a serverless application.</p>
