            <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
            <p>To stand out for junior cloud security, DevOps, or AI ops roles at ElevenLabs, I contributed to their
                open-source <a href="https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-nextjs-starter"
                    class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">elevenlabs-nextjs-starter</a> repository. I added a Terraform
                script to automate the deployment of an AI audio demo on AWS free tier, using Lambda and S3, and
                enhanced the CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions. The pull request reduced demo setup time by about 30%,
                aligning with my Cloud Resume Challenge experience. This project showcases my AWS, Terraform, and CI/CD
                skills while demonstrating my interest in AI voice technology.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">What I Built</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                <li>Terraform Script: Authored a Terraform module to deploy an AWS Lambda function and S3 bucket for
                    hosting an AI audio demo, configuring IAM roles with least-privilege access for secure execution.
                </li>
                <li>CI/CD Enhancement: Integrated GitHub Actions to automate deployment, adding steps for Terraform
                    init, plan, and apply, plus S3 uploads and CloudFront invalidation for the demo frontend.</li>
                <li>Pull Request: Submitted a PR to ElevenLabs' repository with clear documentation, linking to my
                    portfolio (<a href="https://trisoncloudresume.com"
                        class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">trisoncloudresume.com</a>) for hiring visibility.</li>
                <li>Security Focus: Ensured IAM policies restricted Lambda and S3 access, and validated S3 bucket
                    policies to prevent public misconfigurations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Deployment: Forked the repository, tested locally with AWS CLI, and pushed changes via GitHub, ensuring
                compatibility with ElevenLabs' Next.js-based stack.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="mb-6">
            <h2 class="section-title">What I Learned</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                <li>Terraform for AI Workflows: Writing modular Terraform for Lambda and S3 deepened my Infrastructure
                    as Code skills, especially for serverless AI applications.</li>
                <li>CI/CD Optimization: Automating deployments with GitHub Actions taught me to streamline workflows,
                    reducing setup time and ensuring repeatability.</li>
                <li>Open-Source Contribution: Navigating ElevenLabs' repo and PR process honed my ability to align
                    contributions with project standards and community expectations.</li>
                <li>Security in AI: Applying least-privilege IAM and secure bucket policies reinforced the importance of
                    security in AI-driven cloud deployments.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="mb-6">
            <h2 class="section-title">Hiccups and Troubleshooting</h2>
            <p>Some challenges arose during the project:
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                <li>Terraform State Conflicts: Initial apply failed due to state mismatches in the forked repo. Resolved
                    by initializing a new state file locally and validating with <code>terraform plan</code>.</li>
                <li>IAM Permissions: Lambda execution role lacked S3 access, causing runtime errors. Fixed by updating
                    the IAM policy with <code>s3:GetObject</code> and <code>s3:PutObject</code> permissions.</li>
                <li>CI/CD Syntax Errors: GitHub Actions workflow had YAML indentation issues, similar to past deploy.yml
                    problems. Corrected spacing and tested with a dry run.</li>
                <li>Next.js Compatibility: Ensured the Terraform script aligned with the repo’s Next.js frontend by
                    testing the demo locally with <code>npm run dev</code>.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Double-checked AWS credentials in GitHub Secrets and IAM roles for <code>s3:PutObject</code> and
                <code>lambda:InvokeFunction</code> to avoid deployment issues, leveraging lessons from my Cloud Resume
                Challenge.

            <p>This project demonstrates my ability to contribute impactful, secure, and automated solutions to an
                AI-focused open-source project. It highlights my Terraform and CI/CD expertise, aligns with ElevenLabs'
                innovative AI voice tech, and positions me as a strong candidate for junior cloud security or DevOps
                roles. The PR’s 30% setup time reduction mirrors my Cloud Resume efficiency gains, and linking my
                portfolio ensures hiring managers see my broader skillset.</p>
