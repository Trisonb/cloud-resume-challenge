            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>Completed the Cloud Resume Challenge (CRC), building <strong>this</strong> serverless web
                    application on AWS, integrating S3, CloudFront, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, and Route 53, with
                    automated deployments via GitHub Actions and Terraform infrastructure-as-code.</li>
                <li>Implemented the <i>Spoof Troop</i> security mod, securing DNS for this website using Route 53 with
                    DNSSEC and KMS key signing, protecting against DNS spoofing attacks.</li>
                <li>Applied the <i>Check Your Privilege</i> security mod, enforcing least privilege for Lambda
                    functions and API Gateway roles across production and test accounts, restricting DynamoDB and
                    CloudWatch access to minimize unauthorized actions.</li>
                <li>Deployed the <i>Wall of Fire</i> security mod, integrating a Web Application Firewall
                    (WAF) with AWS-managed rules to protect the CloudFront distribution, mitigating common web attacks
                    like SQL injection and XSS.</li>
                <li>Completed the <i>Chain Reaction</i> security mod, hardening the CI/CD pipeline with GitHub
                    Actions by limiting repository permissions, removing sensitive debug outputs, and scoping IAM
                    permissions for S3, CloudFront, and Terraform operations, reducing supply chain attack risks.</li>
                <li>Contributed to securing Democratic Senate seats in 2022 (Fetterman) and 2024 (Gallego) through
                    impactful ad campaigns, leveraging strategic communication and video production.</li>
