            <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
            <p>As part of expanding my cloud resume portfolio, I wanted a quick, fun project to demonstrate security
                awareness without adding backend complexity. The result: an SQL Injection Game! It's a simple chat box
                where users try SQL injection attempts (e.g., "DROP TABLE users;"), and a bot detects them with regex,
                roasts the user snarkily (with emojis for extra fun), and logs attempts to the console. Everything runs
                client-side on my static S3-hosted siteâ€”no real database, just string matching for common attacks. Time
                spent: about 20 minutes, as planned.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">What I Built</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                <li>HTML structure: A chat container with input, submit button, and scrollable message area, integrated
                    as a separate page (/sql-game.html) linked from the "Projects" section.</li>
                <li>JavaScript logic: Regex patterns to detect attacks like DROP, SELECT *, UNION, etc. The bot responds
                    with tailored roasts (e.g., "Whoa, trying to DROP TABLE? That's so 90s! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜œ") or a default nudge
                    for non-malicious input.</li>
                <li>Logging: Timestamped console logs for each attempt (e.g., "[2025-09-08T13:59:00.000Z] User input:
                    DROP TABLE users;").</li>
                <li>Styling: Matches the site's retro matrix theme using VT323 font, green text, and black backgrounds.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Deployment: Added files to GitHub Actions for S3 upload and CloudFront invalidationâ€”no Terraform changes
                needed.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="mb-6">
            <h2 class="section-title">What I Learned</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                <li>Regex mastery: Crafting patterns for SQL injections (e.g., /(drop\s+(table|database))/i) taught me
                    efficient string matching without overcomplicating for false positives.</li>
                <li>Frontend interactivity: DOM manipulation for dynamic chat updates and scrolling enhanced my JS
                    skills for static sites.</li>
                <li>Security simulation: It reinforced why parameterized queries matter in real apps, even in a fun
                    demo.</li>
                <li>Integration: Keeping it lightweight ensured seamless fit with S3/CloudFront, aligning with
                    serverless principles.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="mb-6">
            <h2 class="section-title">Hiccups and Troubleshooting</h2>
            <p>Minimal issues since it was frontend-only:
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                <li>Styling alignment: Tweaked CSS to match the matrix themeâ€”ensuring the chat box didn't clash with the
                    rain effect.</li>
                <li>Regex tuning: Initially, simple patterns missed variations (e.g., case-insensitivity), so added /i
                    flags and tested common attacks locally.</li>
                <li>Emojis: Added them for fun, but confirmed they rendered consistently across browsers.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>No major deployment snags, but as always, double-checked YAML indentation in deploy.yml (use spaces!),
                GitHub Secrets for AWS keys, and IAM permissions (e.g., s3:PutObject, cloudfront:CreateInvalidation) to
                prevent past errors like failed uploads.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Why It's Cool for a Cloud Resume</h2>
            <p>This project adds a playful, interactive element to my portfolio, showcasing quick prototyping and
                security concepts without heavy lifting. It highlights my ability to build engaging frontend features on
                a static site, ties into cloud security (simulating SQLi defense), and demonstrates CI/CD integration
                via GitHub Actions. Plus, it's a conversation starter for interviewsâ€”proving I can blend humor with tech
                skills!</p>
