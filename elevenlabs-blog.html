            <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
            <p>I’m a huge fan of ElevenLabs’ AI voice tech, so I jumped at the chance to contribute to their <a
                    href="https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-nextjs-starter"
                    class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">open-source project</a>. My goal was to make it easier for
                anyone to test their AI voice demo on AWS without spending a dime, using skills from my Cloud Resume
                Challenge. I added a setup that deploys a demo in minutes, complete with a custom “Hey ElevenLabs, I
                love your software!” voice clip. This project cut setup time by about 30% and shows my pivot from
                politics to IT, aiming for roles in cloud security, DevOps, or AI ops.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">What I Built</h2>
            <p>I contributed a pull request to the <a
                    href="https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-nextjs-starter/pull/4"
                    class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">elevenlabs-nextjs-starter</a> repo with:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                <li>A Terraform setup (terraform/main.tf) to automatically create an AWS Lambda function and S3 bucket,
                    making it super easy to deploy the demo on AWS’ free tier.</li>
                <li>A Python script (index.py) that safely uses ElevenLabs’ API to generate a voice clip with the Adam
                    voice, saying, “Hey ElevenLabs — I absolutely love your software…” and saves it to S3 as output.mp3.
                </li>
                <li>Secure API key storage using AWS Secrets Manager, so no one’s keys are left in plain text.</li>
                <li>An updated README with clear, beginner-friendly steps to deploy and test the demo.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I tested everything locally with AWS CLI to ensure the voice clip lands in
                <code>s3://elevenlabs-demo-bucket-&lt;random-suffix&gt;/output.mp3</code>, ready to play!

            <h2 class="section-title">What I Learned</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                <li>Simplifying Cloud Setups: Using Terraform to automate AWS deployments makes complex tech accessible,
                    especially for free-tier users.</li>
                <li>Secure Coding: Storing API keys in Secrets Manager (not hardcoding them!) is a must for real-world
                    apps.</li>
                <li>AI Integration: Working with ElevenLabs’ API showed me how cool it is to blend cloud skills with AI
                    tech.</li>
                <li>Open-Source Vibes: Contributing to a real project taught me how to write clear docs and make PRs
                    that others can actually use.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="mb-6">
            <h2 class="section-title">Hiccups and Troubleshooting</h2>
            <p>It wasn’t all smooth sailing, but I tackled these bumps:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                <li>Lambda Errors: The Lambda function failed with an “Unhandled” error because it couldn’t access the
                    S3 bucket. I added the right permissions (<code>s3:PutObject</code>) to the Lambda role and
                    retested.</li>
                <li>Terraform Snags: My first Terraform apply didn’t work due to a mix-up with the setup files. I
                    restarted with a clean setup and double-checked with <code>terraform plan</code>.</li>
                <li>API Key Safety: I initially forgot to set up Secrets Manager properly, so I fixed it to keep the API
                    key secure.</li>
                <li>Testing Woes: The voice clip didn’t generate at first due to a typo in the Python script. A quick
                    debug with AWS CloudWatch logs saved the day.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These fixes leaned on my Cloud Resume Challenge experience, like checking AWS permissions and debugging
                with CLI, which made troubleshooting feel familiar.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Why It's Cool for a Cloud Resume</h2>
            <p>This project is my way of saying, “Hey ElevenLabs, I’m ready for IT!” It shows I can build something
                practical with AWS and Terraform, make it secure, and save time—cutting setup by ~30%. It’s a perfect
                fit for ElevenLabs’ AI voice mission and highlights my pivot from politics to cloud security and DevOps.
