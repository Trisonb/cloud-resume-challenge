            <h2 class="section-title">Why I Jumped In</h2>
            <p>ElevenLabs’ AI voice tech is incredible, so I dove into their <a
                    href="https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-nextjs-starter"
                    class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">open-source repo</a> to make it easier for developers and
                hobbyists to test it. My goal? Build a tool that cuts demo setup time by ~30%, letting anyone explore
                their text-to-speech API on AWS Free Tier without battling complex configs. This project showcases my
                AWS and Terraform skills for junior cloud security or DevOps roles, while aligning with ElevenLabs’
                mission to advance AI audio. It’s also a step in my journey from politics to IT—check out my portfolio

            <h2 class="section-title">What I Built</h2>
            <p>I submitted a pull request to the <a
                    href="https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-nextjs-starter/pull/4"
                    class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">elevenlabs-nextjs-starter</a> repo to simplify testing
                ElevenLabs’ AI voice API. The tool saves ~30% of setup time, letting developers and hobbyists focus on
                creating with AI audio instead of wrestling AWS. Here’s what’s included:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                <li>A Terraform script (main.tf) that sets up an AWS Lambda, S3 bucket, and IAM roles, all
                    optimized for the Free Tier.</li>
                <li>A Python script (index.py) that calls ElevenLabs’ API to generate a “Hey ElevenLabs”
                    MP3 and saves it to S3, with dependencies like requests included.</li>
                <li>Dynamic bucket naming using environment variables to avoid hardcoding errors.</li>
                <li>An updated README.md with clear, beginner-friendly steps: add your API key, run
                    Terraform, get your voice clip.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This setup makes experimenting with ElevenLabs’ tech fast, accessible, and fun, with no cloud expertise
                required.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">What I Learned</h2>
            <p>This project deepened my understanding of cloud and open-source work, while highlighting why tools like
                this matter:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                <li><strong>Terraform’s Value</strong>: It’s a great tool for automating AWS, though it can be
                    frustrating when configs need tweaking.</li>
                <li><strong>Lambda Dependencies</strong>: Missing libraries like requests or
                    idna causes crashes. Zipping them all up is critical.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Configs</strong>: Environment variables for bucket names saved tons of rework,
                    making the tool more reliable.</li>
                <li><strong>Open-Source Impact</strong>: Clear docs and a clean PR ensure others can use this to explore
                    AI audio easily.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-title">Challenges and Solutions</h2>
            <p>Building this had its challenges, but I tackled them to keep the tool user-friendly:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                <li><strong>Bucket Name Issues</strong>: Random bucket names used uppercase letters, which AWS rejected.
                    I fixed it by enforcing lowercase in Terraform.</li>
                <li><strong>Lambda Errors</strong>: “Unhandled” errors, likely from an API key or voice ID issue, are
                    still under investigation. I’m testing the API locally to pinpoint the cause.</li>
                <li><strong>Missing Dependencies</strong>: Lambda failed without requests and other
                    libraries. I included them in the ZIP file.</li>
                <li><strong>Log Access</strong>: CloudWatch threw a “ResourceNotFoundException,” possibly due to
                    permissions. I’m exploring workarounds like local testing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Using AWS CLI and lessons from my Cloud Resume Challenge helped me resolve most issues, ensuring the tool
                streamlines AI voice testing.</p>
